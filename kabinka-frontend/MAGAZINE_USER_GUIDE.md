## Understanding Magazine

### What Makes Magazine Different?

#### Not Like Social Feeds

- ✅ Finite content (no endless scroll)
- ✅ Opt-in (you choose to visit)
- ✅ Clear labeling (all ads marked "Sponsored")
- ❌ Never appears in your timeline
- ❌ No algorithmic insertion
- ❌ No tracking or profiling

#### Design Philosophy
- **Paper-like**: Cards mimic magazine pages
- **Gesture-driven**: Natural, tactile interactions
- **Transparent**: Clear disclosure on all ads
- **Local-first**: Focus on community creators

### Ad Categories
- **App**: Software and digital tools
- **Art**: Galleries, exhibitions, artists
- **Local**: Small businesses, services
- **Event**: Concerts, shows, gatherings
- **Music**: Venues, musicians, festivals
- **Fashion**: Clothing, accessories
- **Food & Drink**: Restaurants, cafes, markets
- **Culture**: Theater, films, cultural events
- **Other**: Everything else

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficient Browsing
1. **Quick scan**: Scroll through issue to preview all ads
2. **Circle interesting ones**: Double-tap to save for later
3. **Dismiss noise**: Swipe away irrelevant ads
4. **Deep dive**: Tear off to read full details

### Managing Circled Ads
- Circled ads show a badge in the top-right
- Currently saved for session only

### Gesture Best Practices
- **Double-tap**: Tap card center for reliable detection
- **Swipe**: Make deliberate gestures (>200px)

- **Vertical swipe**: Keep mostly downward

### Dark Mode
Magazine fully supports dark mode:

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't I scroll forever?**  
A: Magazine is intentionally finite. Each issue contains a curated selection, like a real magazine. This prevents ad fatigue and maintains quality.

A: No. Never. Magazine is completely separate. Ads only appear when you visit Magazine.

**Q: How do I find my circled ads?**  
A: Currently, circled ads show a badge on the card. A dedicated collection view is planned for future updates.

A: Not in the current session. The ad disappears from view. It will reappear if you close and reopen the issue.

**Q: How long until my submission is reviewed?**  
A: Editorial team reviews within 5-7 business days. You'll receive an email update.

A: Submission is free. Standard rates apply for approved placements.

**Q: Can I edit a submission after sending?**
